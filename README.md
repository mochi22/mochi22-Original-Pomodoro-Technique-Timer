# pomodoro-mac-menubar

## Description
This is a tool that makes it easy to use Pomodoro Technique on the Mac menu bar!

## how to use
This is using py2app.
So, you should exute following command.
```
python setup.py py2app
```

Maybe, uv conflict py2app...


There is no problem with py2app as a personal application, but there are points where it is difficult to publish and manage, so I'm looking forward to future updates...
